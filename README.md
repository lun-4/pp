# pp

a safer wrapper around dd(1)

are you a sysadmin?

are you sad `--dry-run` has not been evangelized to you yet?

well look no more:

## installing

- linux only because i know sysfs exists there

```
git clone https://github.com/lun-4/pp.git
cd pp
sudo make install
```

## uninstalling

```
sudo make uninstall
```
